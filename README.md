# rock_paper_scissors
My first JavaScript project!

I built this project as part of my journey on The Odin Project. It let's you play a couple rounds of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer and declares the winner at the very end. I learned how to actually use functions in a practical way, got a chance to refresh my knowledge on IF statements, and using GitHub as well as learning something new about loops, different JavaScript methods and linking .html and .js files. 

UPDATE: I then revisited the project once more, to update it using some of the DOM skills which were covered in the previous lessons.
